        <h2 className="about-subtitle">Who I am as a person and a developer</h2>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          Hello! I am Maria Hudymenko, a Computer Science student with a strong
          passion for programming and software development. While I primarily
          focus on web development, my skills extend to software development,
          working with databases, and process automation. My goal is to create
          user-friendly, efficient, and innovative solutions using a broad range
          of technologies.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          I work as a Front-end, Back-end, and even C++ developer, which allows
          me to combine different approaches in creating programs and make projects
          more scalable and functional. Additionally, I have experience working
          with databases and designing schemas, which adds depth to my understanding
          of software architecture.

        <h2 className="about-subtitle">My Values and Passions</h2>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          I am always striving to grow and learn new technologies. I enjoy solving
          complex problems, working in teams, and finding ways to optimize and automate
          processes. My passion for programming goes beyond just building websites â€”
          I actively explore new tools and methods in other areas of software engineering.
